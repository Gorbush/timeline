# Adjust this with the number of parallel workers / tasks to be allowed
# Depends on your machine; for a NAS with 4GB and 4 processors a limit of 1
# seems reasonable
# On something more powerful 4-6 is good
# In general a good approach is to go with the number of physical processors
# The workers are on one hand CPU intensive but on the other hand also
# memory intensive as the loaded models for face and thing detection
# already eat up a a few hundret megabyte. 
# That means that a single worker process need around 1.9GB RAM. 
# In case you only have as NAS with 4GB just just use one. With 8GB 2-3 should work.
# On my Dev machine with 16GB RAM 6 workers are ok
# Once the workers are done anymore they will shut down and only 1 worker will 
# remain. That means if the initial work is done the memory (and CPU) 
# footprint should reduce
